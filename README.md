> Comparing various hardware configurations needed for different data sizes, from personal laptops to mainframes.

#

The provided table presents a detailed overview of various hardware configurations needed for different data sizes, from personal laptops to mainframes. Each row in the table corresponds to a specific type of computer and outlines the required specifications such as CPU cores, RAM, storage capacity, network bandwidth, and processing time. Additionally, it includes real-world examples of CPUs suitable for each type of computer and a calculated file size in megabytes (MB) for consistent comparison.

Visualizing the data helps in understanding the relationships and scaling requirements between different hardware components. The first plot shows the relationship between data size and the number of CPU cores, which increases linearly as the data size grows. This indicates that higher data processing requirements demand more powerful CPUs. Similarly, the second plot compares RAM requirements, where a significant increase in RAM is necessary as data size escalates from megabytes to gigabytes and terabytes.

The third plot highlights storage and network bandwidth requirements, which both show exponential growth with increasing data sizes. The storage capacity (in terabytes) and network bandwidth (in gigabits per second) reflect the need for substantial infrastructure to handle large-scale data. Finally, the processing time, shown in the last plot, also scales with data size, underscoring the importance of efficient hardware configurations to manage extensive data processing within reasonable time frames.
